The magical city of Venice, captured through the lens of @branislavsimoncik represents the true essence of Italian beauty, through an astonishing tour around its so-called “Calli”, the typical Venetian streets, and its celebrated treasures.  
 
The #DGAltaModa look is composed of a hand-painted triple Mikado jacket with velvet detailing embroidered with Lurex brocade, Lurex lace, crystals and cabochons, and embellished with jewelled buttons, paired with Lurex brocade trousers.
