«  The French Ester Manas and the Belgian Balthazar Delepierre are one of the nicest and most pleasant couples in the fashion world. These two, as young as excited, began their journey together with a clear mission: to make people happy. To achieve this goal, they created a clothing brand that bears Ester’s name, “Ester Manas,” to break taboos and to start a realistic and committed dialogue between designer and consumer, between industry and environment. After their Fall/Winter 2022 collection entitled “Come As You Are,” and the success of their recent collaboration with AZ Factory, the brand created by this talented duo has managed to wash the face of an industry that as ofter been too exclusive and inaccessible and that for years has neglected so many types of bodies and skin colors. But enough is enough and these two designers, with humility as their mantra, just want to welcome everyone while continuing doing what they love just being themselves: Ester and Balthazar, the world is yours. »
