I’m happy to announce our new collection and show « L’amour », 

A year ago we decided to slow down our cycle by showing womenswear and menswear together in january and june.This allows us to reduce the number of shows, mutualize fabrics for menswear and womenswear and slower the pace for my team and partners. 

More than a creative choice, it’s a sustainable model we believe in and that works for us
