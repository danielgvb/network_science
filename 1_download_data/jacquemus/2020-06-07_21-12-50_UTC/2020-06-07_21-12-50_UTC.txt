I spent my childhood sleeping in her bed foot to foot. I spent my childhood disguising myself with her. I spent my childhood decorating the house when she was going to the supermarket. I spent my childhood serving her syrups late at midnight at night. I spent my childhood laughing and crying in your arms. I spent my childhood dancing with her on the sofa listening to Marie La Forêt loudly. I spent my childhood in your skirts, dresses and heels. I spent my childhood dreaming that everything was possible. 
Thank you, je t’aime.
