So happy to open tomorrow «  LA BOUTIQUE MONTAIGNE » !
This is a dream come true for me, it’s very symbolic to be back Avenue Montaigne 11 years later.
First time I was there was when I showed my 3rd collection during Vogue fashion night in front of everyone, back in 2011.
The boutique will open tomorrow at 10am with 2 pop corn machines offering pop corn all day long.
Can’t wait to see you there.
🤍
