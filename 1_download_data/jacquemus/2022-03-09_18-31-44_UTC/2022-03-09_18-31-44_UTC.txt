 «LE SPLASH»
For our first show staged outside of France, JACQUEMUS is presenting it’s Spring/Summer 2022 collection on O‘ahu. The islands of Hawai‘i, with their awe-inspiring landscapes, diverse climates, and untold biodiversity, stood out as the perfect complement to the exuberant Le Splash collec- tion. This show takes inspiration from JACQUEMUS’s 2021 campaign shot by Tom Kneller on O‘ahu, and for Simon, who has long wished to visit the islands, it marks the culmination of both a personal and professional dream.
As a guest to Hawai‘i, JACQUEMUS is taking great care to respect this location, culture, and way of life. We are primarily working with talent and businesses from O‘ahu and the neighbouring islands to leave as small of a footprint as possible. A curated guest list of local VIPs and friends of the brand, predominantly from the Asia-Pacific region, will enjoy the natural beauty of the island, with our signature colour pop runway staged on the beach and overlooked by the breathtaking Ko‘olau mountain range.
