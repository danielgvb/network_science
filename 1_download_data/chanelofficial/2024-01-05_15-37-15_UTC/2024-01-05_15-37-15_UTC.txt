An extraordinarily powerful flower. 
CHANEL researchers have spent more than 19 years studying an extraordinary flower: the camellia.
 
One variety in particular, the red camellia, became the central ingredient in the N°1 DE CHANEL anti-aging beauty line and is known for its antioxidant properties.
 
For the very first time, CHANEL Research has conducted a comprehensive skin tissue analysis in order to measure the effects of red camellia extract, the main ingredient in the N°1 DE CHANEL revitalizing serum.
 
This powerful active ingredient boosts skin vitality mechanisms by 63%(1) to keep it youthful.
