Opening the CHANEL 2023/24 Métiers d’art show on Thomas Street in Manchester, a short, stand-collar coat dress fitted close to the body is cut in a grey brick-patterned tweed and lined with houndstooth cherry red silk worn over crushed velvet cycling shorts with a crochet trim. 
Celebrating the CHANEL art of tailoring, the silhouette is enhanced with a multicoloured jewelled belt worn with matching cuffs, and flat Mary-Jane shoes adorned with CHANEL charms.
