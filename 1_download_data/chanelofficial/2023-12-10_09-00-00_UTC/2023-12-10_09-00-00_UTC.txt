Transforming denim with a feminine allure, a poetic look from the CHANEL 2023/24 Métiers d’art collection by Virginie Viard shown on Thomas Street in Manchester is treated with a washed black effect, featuring matching turn-up jean shorts like pedal pushers and a ruffled shirt strung with a pearl belt and crystal buttons.  

A cut-out ‘fringe’ headpiece is finished with a satin bow, in an ode to musical references that punctuate the collection.
