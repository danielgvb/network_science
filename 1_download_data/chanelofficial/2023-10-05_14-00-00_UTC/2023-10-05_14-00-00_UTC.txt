In a fantasy expression of the architectural gardens of the villa Noailles in the south of France, pencil skirts from the CHANEL Spring-Summer 2024 Ready-to-Wear collection are shaped in black duchesse satin with a geometric pocket embroidered in Cubist sequins and crystal trims, worn with sailor-inspired tops in gold lurex stripes or black crochet ribbon with a sailorâ€™s collar.
