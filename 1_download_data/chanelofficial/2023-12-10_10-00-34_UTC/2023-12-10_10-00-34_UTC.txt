Swapping short skirts for city shorts, the characters of the CHANEL 2023/24 Métiers d’art collection by Virginie Viard shown on Thomas Street in Manchester mix and match tonal tweeds, like this deep purple houndstooth suit resplendent with contrasting ‘tweed’ embroidered pocket flaps and lined with multicoloured pin patterned silk. 

Poetic touches abound, from a fancy knit patchwork sweater with a suede bow plastron, to a classic handbag finished in smoky pink quilted leather.
