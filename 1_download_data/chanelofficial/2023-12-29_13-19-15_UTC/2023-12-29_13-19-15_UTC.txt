TWEED de CHANEL. The TWEED CAMBON Necklace

Patrice Leguéreau, Director of the CHANEL Fine Jewelry Creation Studio, expresses tweed like it has never been done before: a weave of tweed in gold paved with diamonds, as supple and harmonious as the fabric that inspired it. At the center of the necklace, a 3.19-carat brilliant-cut DFL diamond, set majestically in the middle of a detachable sun motif. A necklace created through a remarkable technical feat, the result of 1,450 hours of work. 

Keira Knightley wears the TWEED CAMBON necklace and ring.
