“For me, Manchester is the city of music. It incites creation,” says Virginie Viard, reflecting on her inspirations for the CHANEL 2023/24 Métiers d’art show that took place on Thomas Street, in the Northern Quarter of the city. 

Embodying this spirit and the precious savoir-faire preserved by the Maisons d’art at 𝘭𝘦19M, a strapless bustier dress in black velvet cinched with a multi-buckle chain belt is festooned with sequins, photographic prints and patent embroidery to evoke a scalloped pattern of vinyl records across the bust.
