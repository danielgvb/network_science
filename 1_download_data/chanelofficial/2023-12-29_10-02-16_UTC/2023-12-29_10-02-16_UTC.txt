TWEED de CHANEL.

Patrice Leguéreau, Director of the CHANEL Fine Jewelry Creation Studio, expresses tweed like it has never been done before: a tweed of precious stones that lies on the body with the suppleness of fabric. Bringing together the symbols of the House, tweed takes on a narrative quality and weaves 5 stories: those of the ribbon, the camellia, the comet, the sun and the lion.

Keira Knightley wears pieces from the TWEED de CHANEL Collection.
