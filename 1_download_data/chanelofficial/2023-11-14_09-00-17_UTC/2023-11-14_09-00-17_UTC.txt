Spotlight on "Chiroptera", a project by JR, Damien Jalet and Thomas Bangalter, presented as part of the Act II of “Retour à la Caverne”, the collaboration between the Paris Opera, JR and 𝘭𝘦19M, the Parisian building dedicated to the savoir-faire of the Fashion and Interior Design Métiers d'art.

As part of the restoration works at the Palais Garnier, the Paris Opera invited JR to offer a visual metamorphosis of the institution’s monumental façade. On the occasion of an unprecedented show with 154 dancers choreographed by Damien Jalet on a music by Thomas Bangalter, CHANEL designed the costume worn by Étoile dancer Amandine Albisson during her solo opening the show, reminding the House's enduring commitment to creation and dance. The House also supported the design and fabrication of costumes for the 153 dancers.
