Behind the scenes of "Chiroptera", a project by JR, Damien Jalet and Thomas Bangalter, presented as part of the Act II of “Retour à la Caverne”, the collaboration between the Paris Opera, JR and 𝘭𝘦19M, the Parisian building dedicated to the savoir-faire of the Fashion and Interior Design Métiers d'art.

As part of the restoration works at the Palais Garnier, the Paris Opera invited JR to offer a visual metamorphosis of the institution’s monumental façade. Giving everyone a chance to take part in the creation of this art installation, hundreds of handprints were collected and embroidered during public workshops with Atelier Montex, a Maison d’art resident at 𝘭𝘦19M, the Parisian building dedicated to the savoir-faire of the Fashion and Interior Design Métiers d'art.They have been brought together to ornate the walls of the cavern in the style of cave art. The curtain rose to reveal an unprecedented show with 154 dancers choreographed by Damien Jalet on a music by Thomas Bangalter. Reminding the House's enduring commitment to creation and dance, the costume worn by Étoile dancer Amandine Albisson during her solo opening the show was designed and made by CHANEL. The House also supported the design and fabrication of costumes for the 153 dancers.
