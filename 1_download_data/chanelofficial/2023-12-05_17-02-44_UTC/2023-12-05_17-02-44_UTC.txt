Creative dialogue is at the heart of every CHANEL Métiers d’art collection. It lies within the work between Artistic Director of the Fashion collections Virginie Viard, the ateliers at rue Cambon, the Maisons d’art at 𝘭𝘦19M, and connects artists and friends of the House, cities and cultures, season after season.

CHANEL has chosen to present the 2023/24 Métiers d’art show in Manchester, one of the most effervescent cities of pop culture and an avant-garde one, whose bands, spanning all genres, have changed the history of music.

Montage by Sofia Coppola.

The film of the show will be revealed on Friday, December 8th 2023 at 9am Manchester time, 10am Paris time.
