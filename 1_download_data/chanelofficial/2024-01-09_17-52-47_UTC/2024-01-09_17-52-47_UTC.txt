Some encounters you wear forever.

For Gabrielle Chanel, every encounter was a game where luck and destiny intersect. With clean and even incisions that crisscross the curved surface of each piece, the COCO CRUSH collection is a story of encounters.

Korean singer and CHANEL ambassador @jennierubyjane wears COCO CRUSH rings, bracelets and earrings in BEIGE GOLD or white gold, with or without diamonds.
