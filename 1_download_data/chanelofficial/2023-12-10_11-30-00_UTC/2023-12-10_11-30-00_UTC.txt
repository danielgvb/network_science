Strung with jade green pearls and crystal sautoirs, the CHANEL little black dress is given a glamorous touch of classic English style for the CHANEL 2023/24 Métiers d’art collection with a shapely peplum and puff sleeves all draped from a chequered double C and camellia silk jacquard. Cinched at the waist with a jewelled belt, it is worn with grosgrain bow sandals adorned with pearl ankle straps.
