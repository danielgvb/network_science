A nod to the codes of the House â€” double Cs, charms, and the letters of CHANEL are reinterpreted through playful motifs present on an embroidered velvet ensemble from the CHANEL 2023/24 COCO NEIGE collection.

Actress and House ambassador Lily-Rose Depp is photographed by Mikael Jansson.

The collection is now available in a selection of boutiques.
