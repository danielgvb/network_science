Spotlight on "Chiroptera", a project by JR, Damien Jalet and Thomas Bangalter, presented as part of the Act II of ‚ÄúRetour √† la Caverne‚Äù, the collaboration between the Paris Opera, JR and ùò≠ùò¶19M, the Parisian building dedicated to the savoir-faire of the Fashion and Interior Design M√©tiers d'art.

As part of the restoration works at the Palais Garnier, the Paris Opera invited JR to offer a visual metamorphosis of the institution‚Äôs monumental fa√ßade. On the occasion of an unprecedented show choreographed by Damien Jalet on a music by Thomas Bangalter, the curtain rose to reveal a performance with 154 dancers. Reminding the House's enduring commitment to creation and dance, the costume worn by √âtoile dancer Amandine Albisson performing in the show was designed and made by CHANEL. The House also supported the design and fabrication of costumes for the 153 dancers.

Watch the full performance on the CHANEL official YouTube channel and on the Paris Opera Play platform.
