Celebrating Pride with H&M. As part of the festivities we hosted the world’s largest drag brunch in Brooklyn. This Pride, we’re honouring chosen families. Because family is the people who love you, no matter who you love. @harinef @mjrodriguez7 @dominiquet.a.r.jackson @tommy.dorfman @ageofaquaria @aaron___philip @im_linux @thelittlesaint360 #HMPride #HMWilliamsburg
