“For this collaboration, I wanted to do everything I’d never do and anything I had never done. I wanted to explore shapes that were new to me, a very geometrical, simplified (if not simplistic) décor, and of course pay tribute to Paco Rabanne’s original world and era through colours and material. I valued his artistic vision, his taste. The collection itself encapsulates that spirit, and gives us something more modern, more democratic to look at and wear.” @xavierdolan ,Director
