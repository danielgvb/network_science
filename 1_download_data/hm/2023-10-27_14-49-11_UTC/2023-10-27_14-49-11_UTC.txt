Brilliant homeware by @juliendossena for #rabanneHM, a first for the designer and @rabanne.

“Our founder, Paco Rabanne, was obsessed with covering everything in metal, and he did some furniture in the 1970s, which was of course metallic, so it felt like an authentic extension for the house.” @juliendossena, @rabanne’s creative director

Rabanne H&M HOME will be available at selected @hmhome stores and online in selected markets 9 November.
