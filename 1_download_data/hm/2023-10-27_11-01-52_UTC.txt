“Rabanne is a brand built on radical materiality — Paco Rabanne was unique in the fashion landscape for his use of chain mail. The metallic mesh is such an interesting material to work with, and it’s extraordinary to wear — more sensual than silk, but also protective, like armour.” @juliendossena, @rabanne’s creative director

#rabanneHM launches 9 November.
